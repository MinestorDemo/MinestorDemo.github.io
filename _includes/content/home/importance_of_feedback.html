        You're only as good as the feedback you receive
    </h3>

Feedback is the lifeblood of great customer service and any improvement to customer experience, but many customers either don't bother, or simply walk away. Worse still, dissatisfied customers will tell their friends – and increasingly opt to publicise their experience on social media.

<p>
It is critical for businesses to encourage their customers to give feedback directly, at the point where it matter most. But given that almost one in five of UK businesses don’t respond to email enquiries from customers, it is unsurprising that many people lack faith in traditional communication channels, or view feedback systems as a black-hole.

Your business needs tools that engage customers and enable you to respond to feedback quickly and positively. In turn, this helps boost customer retention and loyalty, while turning negative experiences into potentially positive outcomes.
