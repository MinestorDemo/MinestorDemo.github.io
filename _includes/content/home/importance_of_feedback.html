        The importance of feedback
    </h3>

<p>
Feedback is the lifeblood of great customer service. But many customers opt to remain silent if they have a bad service experience and you simply lose their custom. Worse still, dissatisfied customers will tell their friends – and increasingly opt to publicise their experience on social media.
</p>
<p>
So it is critically important for businesses to encourage their customers to give feedback directly where it matters – to the company itself. But given that almost one in five of UK businesses don’t respond to email enquiries from customers, it is unsurprising that many people lack faith in traditional communication channels.

As a result, your business needs to use tools that really engage your customers. Reactn is a powerful tool to encourage customers to give feedback, and to help you respond to feedback positively. In turn, this can help boost customer retention and loyalty.
