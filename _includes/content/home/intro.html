Your customers know more about your business than you do. At any moment they could be experiencing poor service, broken facilities and delayed deliveries – and you’ll either know nothing about it, or you’ll have to deal with unexpected comments on social media. Over 1 million people view tweets about customer service every week, and around four in five of those tweets are negative or critical. Reactn can help. Reactn is a powerful customer feedback platform that is revolutionising the way organisations collect, distribute and act on customer insight and opinion. Through Reactn, you can know where a customer is when they make a comment, who is on-site to help, and the action they can take to fix a problem there and then. As a result, Reactn helps minimise leakage to social media, where issues become much harder to manage and contain.
