<p>
    Constantly shifting landscapes, having to do more with less, pressure from wider stakeholders and more insight on the impact of operations to the bottom line. This is the (often) grim reality faced by operations professionals.
</p>
<p>
    Reactn directly addresses the gap between marketing-based expectations and operations-based reality. This is not only through the measurement of customer sentiment and feedback, but also through the changes to these metrics over-time and in different areas of the business. This allows operations professionals to pin-point areas for improvement and investment. Areas that will have maximum impact on perception and performance.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, Reactn streamlines and digitises fault reporting and maintenance issues, allowing you customer-base to highlight problems across the wider areas of your estate on a constant and continuous basis. It even allows you to integrate these reports with third party facilities and maintenance teams, as well as run and manage ticketing systems to ensure maximum efficiency in resolving all improvements.
</p>
<p>
    The Reactn system’s sweet-spot targets areas of the business that are underperforming or can be resolved quickly by employees on the ground. We automate this process and let the customer know what you’ve done to address their issue, freeing up time and resource.
