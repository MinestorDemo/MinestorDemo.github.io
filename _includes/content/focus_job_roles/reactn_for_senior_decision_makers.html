        Reactn for Senior Decision Makers
    </h3>
</div>
<p>
    Reactn places customers at the heart of your business and provides peace of mind that your business is doing all it can to listen to customer opinions and more critically act on them. Specifically, Reactn gives you direct access to what is happening in real-time, removing the fear that an ͞impervious͟ middle management layer is keeping customer insight from decision makers and strategic direction from employees.
</p>
<p>
    Reactn works to empower every employee in your business, bringing customer service front and centre to your strategic planning and as an active and constant measure of your organisation’s performance.
</p>
<p>
    More immediate benefits are also felt through the act of becoming a listening business. And while this may expose both good and bad elements, Reactn acts as a window on underperforming sites, departments and individuals. While we built a system for good, this good can sometimes mean reorganisation and change. Reactn acts as a barometer for targeting change management strategies and measuring success.
