    Customer service professionals need to deliver consistent experience , while informing the business on where to make investments for maximum return.
</p>
<p>
    This challenge is heightened by the limited measures currently available in the form of surveys, social media sentiment, or sales data.
</p>
<p>
    By introducing Reactn to the knowledge process, customer services can actively work on day-to-day customer engagement, pulling resource from across different functional lines into the process. This breaks-down divisional silos and treats customers as individuals, whilst also aggregating data for better decision making.
</p>
<p>
    Reactn enables you to treat complaints, feedback and ideas as a source for improvement. It also enables customer service and experience teams to focus investment where it matter most and measure the granular impact these investments have on business success.
