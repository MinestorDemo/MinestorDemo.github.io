<p>
    In order to set parameters and address accurate measures, many customer insights professional s fall into the trap of rigorous survey methodologies and sample sizes. While this remains an excellent way of putting stakes in the ground, it is too rigid and inflexible for real time environments.
</p>
<p>
    Reactn provides continuous and granular insight on areas of improvement, as well as location-specific issues in real time. It is used to immediately address issues of dissatisfaction and build on areas of outstanding service.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, Reactn disseminates and communicates feedback to wider areas of the business, working with customer insights teams to create knowledge flows that can impact change and development. It can also be used to align insight with the current systems, measures and approaches. All on a constant 24/7 basis, in real-time.
