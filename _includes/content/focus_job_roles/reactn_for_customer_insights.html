    Customer insight requires customer data. But many customer insights professionals fall into a statistical trap by pursuing rigorous survey methodologies and sample sizes.
</p>
<p>
    While this is commendable, it is too rigid and inflexible to give business insight into swiftly changing, real-time environments.

<p>
    Reactn provides continuous and accurate insight on areas requiring improvement, as well as location-specific issues in real time. It is used to immediately address issues of dissatisfaction and build on areas of outstanding service.

<p>
    Reactnâ€™s aggregated knowledge base then becomes a key tool for customer insight, allowing you to collate and analyse data on sentiment, location, feedback and issues over time, by location or by situation.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, Reactn disseminates and communicates feedback to wider areas of the business. Customer insights teams can work with Reactn to create knowledge flows that can impact change and development. It can also be used to align insight with the current systems, measures and approaches. All on a constant 24/7 basis, in real-time.
