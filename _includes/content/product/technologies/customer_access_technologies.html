    Reactn makes it simple for your customers to leave feedback. It has been built with mobile devices and users in mind from the start, and is also available online via standard web browsers.
</p>
<p>
    For regular users, Android and iOS apps (available free to download at the app stores) provide additional functionality, making the user experience richer and easier. The apps enable consumers to store their personal details, speeding up the feedback process and giving them access to their feedback history and to relevant company responses.
</p>
<p>
    The technology makes full use of geo-tagging, allowing users to easily choose the relevant business closest to them when giving feedback on-site or nearby. Alternatively, organisations can drive the feedback process by publicising unique codes for customers to use.
</p>
<p>
    A range of wider access technologies are also available, including website integration, Wi-Fi login screens, and integration with existing applications. Kiosk solutions can also be used to deliver Reactn via static tablets in service-based environments.
