<p>
    Reactn was built to deliver high levels of technical capability, while at the same time ensuring that everyone, both customers and employees, can easily access the system. As a result, we are able to deliver customer feedback to staff using basic email messages, at the same time allowing them to review and respond via company and web-based email accounts.

    In addition, we support staff access to the Reactn platform (either as users, administrators or observers) in order to respond to messages, create and resolve tickets and view dashboards. Again, staff can access this technology from smartphone devices, tablets, laptops and desktop PCs.
