    Reactn was built to deliver high levels of technical capability, while making it easily for customers to use and staff to access.
</p>
<p>
    As a result, we are able to deliver customer feedback to staff using a range of email systems, allowing them to review and respond via company and web-based email accounts.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, we support staff access to the Reactn platform, either as users, administrators or observers. This allows them to respond to messages, create and resolve tickets and view dashboards, from smartphone devices, tablets, laptops and desktop PCs.
