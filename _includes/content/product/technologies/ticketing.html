    The Reactn ticketing system incorporates a powerful, rule-based system to automatically assign, categorise, and prioritise tickets.
</p>
<p>
    This means it routes feedback to the most relevant person in your organisation able to deal with the issue. Reactn also makes it easy to track and resolve feedback, facilitating internal discussions with colleagues, while allowing users to leave notes and communicate service issues and faults to all staff.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, the ticketing system can be used to communicate replies to customers in times of high activity or crisis and queue up staff responses for approval. It can also escalate feedback to other departments better placed to address the issue, or to senior managers to respond. In addition, the system can manage out-of-hours routing of feedback, ensuring that issues are addressed when people return to work, or escalate tickets if an individual fails to respond to a customer concern.
