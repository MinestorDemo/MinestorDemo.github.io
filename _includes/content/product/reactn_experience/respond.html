        Reactn also manages the process of responding to customer feedback. This may take the form of a simple &quot;thank you&quot; or a message communicating that the issue has been escalated, for example. Issues or ideas that have been actioned can then be communicated back to the customer as soon as they are addressed. This includes fixes and changes, which may also by supported by photographic or video evidence.

        Involving customers in such actions closes the feedback loop and enables organisations to turn feedback into positive change and improvement. Most importantly, it shows customers that your business is both listening and reacting to views, ideas and opinions. It encourages more feedback and ultimately a loyal and engaged customer-base.
