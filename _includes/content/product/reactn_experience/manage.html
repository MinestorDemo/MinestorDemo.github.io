Reactn allows your organisation to triage customer feedback, prioritising it according to metrics that you choose. These could be sentiment (how angry or upset a customer is); area of concern (cleanliness, punctuality or staff attitude, for example); or urgency ( e.g. high-priority issues such as safety).
</p>
<p>
Reactn gives you control of your teamâ€™s response from the start of the process, allowing staff the opportunity to correct a fault very quickly. The structured feedback produced by Reactn can be targeted at exactly the right people in your organisation. This means that managers, supervisors and technicians see the feedback they need to see, when they need to see it, helping them prioritise their response.
</p>
<p>
The feedback data collected by Reactn is available 24 hours a day via a dashboard, which can be viewed by incident, user or location. Managers gain up-to-the-minute insight on performance and resolution of issues and concerns, allowing them to direct attention and investment to where they will have the greatest impact.
</p>
<p>
Issues can be resolved based on evidence and their resolution can be measured and logged, improving satisfaction targets. Data is also aggregated, giving senior management rich insights into organisation-wide customer service issues and helping to improve decision-making, investment strategies and resource planning.
</p>
<p>
Feedback trends and patterns can be used to predict problems and anticipate behaviour, both across the business, and by specific location. Whether you are a single or multi-site business, you can improve performance benchmarking, and drive best practice across your organisation.
</p>
<p>
Powerful as it is, Reactn is also agile and flexible, empowering teams by giving them access to questionnaire design, responses and locations to help improve the feedback process.
