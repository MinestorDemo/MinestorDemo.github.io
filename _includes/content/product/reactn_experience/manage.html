Reactn allows your organisation to triage customer feedback, prioritising it according to a range of metrics, such as location, sentiment, areas of concern, or urgency.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px">
The feedback data collected by Reactn is available 24 hours a day via a dashboard, which can be viewed by incident, user or location. Managers gain up-to-the-minute insight on performance and resolution of issues and concerns, allowing them to direct attention and investment to where they will have the greatest impact. Feedback trends and patterns can be used to predict problems and anticipate behaviour, both across the business, and by specific location. Whether you are a single or multi-site business, you can improve performance benchmarking, and drive best practice across your organisation.

Issues can be resolved based on evidence and their resolution can be measured and logged, improving satisfaction targets. Data is also aggregated, giving senior management rich insights into organisation-wide customer service issues and helping to improve decision-making, investment strategies and resource planning. Reactn also gives teams access to questionnaire design, responses and locations to help improve the feedback process.
