        Your customers may be driven to provide feedback in response to a  particular experience â€“ whether good or bad. Otherwise, you could invite feedback through the use of marketing materials, or by a verbal invitation from a member of staff. Reactn helps make this process easy and seamless.
        </p>
        <p>
        Customers who wish to leave feedback for you can use Reactn either online, through the Reactn.com website, or using an iPhone or Android app on their mobile phone or tablet. They can select your organisation from a list delivered to their online device via its inbuilt GPS. They also have the option to enter a unique Reactn code for their location or your business. Alternatively, Reactn clients can provide static tablet devices for data capture onsite.
        </p>
        <p>
        Critically, this means Reactn knows exactly where that customer is, or the precise location of their issue.
