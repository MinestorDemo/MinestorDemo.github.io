Your customers may be driven to provide feedback in response to a particular experience and Reactn makes this process simple. You can also invite feedback through the use of marketing materials or verbal invitations from staff.
</p>
<p>
Customers who wish to leave feedback can do so through the Reactn.com website, or by using an iPhone or Android app on their mobile phone or tablet. They simply select your organisation from a list delivered to their device via its inbuilt GPS, or enter a unique Reactn code for their location or your business. Critically, this means Reactn knows exactly where that customer is, or the precise location of their issue.
