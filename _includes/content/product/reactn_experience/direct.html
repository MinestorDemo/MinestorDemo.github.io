        Once collected, Reactn routes feedback to the most relevant and empowered individual able to deal with it. Individuals and groups can be assigned pieces of feedback based on priority, severity and ownership, as well as those best placed or positioned to deal with the comments.

        Issues on-site can be sent to supervisors, while serious complaints may be escalated to more senior managers, for example. Feedback can be automatically copied to other relevant staff, and Reactn can generate an alert if feedback goes unclaimed.

        Even individual questions, or answers to questions can be directed to individuals for analysis and action. All this is invisible to the customer, who simply wants their issue addressed. Instead, customers can receive prompt and relevant feedback to reassure them that their concerns have been noted and, crucially, acted upon.
