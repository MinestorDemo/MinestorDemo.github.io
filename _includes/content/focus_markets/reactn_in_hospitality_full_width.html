    The Reactn platform not only collects and distributes feedback, it also manages and supports how well service-sector staff address customer needs and resolve issues. Reactn allows you to combine specific feedback at the point of service delivery and strategic analysis over time, to understand your business issues.

    For example, one hospitality client found that its outlets experienced a dip in service on a Tuesday –typically the manager’s day off. This insight helped our client understand it needed to improve training of supervisors to monitor staff performance and raise standards in the manager’s absence.

    Reactn supports strategies that are centred on brand power and customer loyalty. It also dovetails with the growing trend for high-tech and high-touch service solutions. While customers increasingly expect to self-serve, they also require a high quality service experience. Reactn helps you deliver both.
