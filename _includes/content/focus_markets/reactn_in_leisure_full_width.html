    In response to this need, Reactn delivers a location- and time-relevant feedback mechanism that enables you to measure exact elements of your leisure offering, while at the same time collecting feedback on overall experiences and areas that can be improved. It draws customers further into the experience, asking them what they liked and didnâ€™t like, what they would do differently, or even ideas they might have on making things better and more engaging.

    The sentiment data generated by Reactn can be used not only to profile time and location-specific performance, but also aid segmentation and customer profiling. By generating feedback, we can capture details such as location, gender and age, and then use this to segment your customers more precisely. Do retired customers in Newcastle care more about heating than cleanliness? Are 25-34 year olds in Bath more concerned with service friendliness than price? Reactn can be used to profile the customer journey and use this to predict behaviour.

    It also recognises the critical importance of staff performance in making or breaking the customer experience. This enables you to better utilise an often-overlooked asset, while ensuring development and training are targeted precisely for maximum return.
