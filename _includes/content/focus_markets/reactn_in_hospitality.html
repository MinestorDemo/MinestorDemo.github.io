        Reactn in Hospitality
    </h3>

<p>
    Hotels, bars, cafes and restaurants are under increased pressure to deliver a terrific customer experience, by offering innovation, quality and value for money. One way of achieving this is to find better ways of engaging with digitally active customers, especially those who expect personalised and multichannel communication.
</p>
<p>
    Knowing that the hospitality sector lives and dies on the quality of a customer’s last visit, Reactn provides a simple and engaging channel for collecting customer feedback on site. At the same time our content management system is able to aggregate wider social media and review site content such as TripAdvisor alongside feedback generated through Reactn. This can then be directed to both management and front-line staff to address issues and respond to customers.
</p>
<p>
    For large multi-site hospitality businesses, this means keeping on top of performance and customer satisfaction levels by time of day, individual site, and even hotel room. Hospitality providers can also include the performance of corporate suppliers and associated partners in the Reactn data, allowing further operational improvements.
</p>
<p>
    The Reactn platform not only collects and distributes feedback, it also manages and supports how well service-sector staff address customer needs and resolve issues. Reactn allows you to combine specific feedback at the point of service delivery and strategic analysis over time, to understand your business issues.
</p>
<p>
    For example, one hospitality client found that its outlets experienced a dip in service on a Tuesday –typically the manager’s day off. This insight helped our client understand it needed to improve training of supervisors to monitor staff performance and raise standards in the manager’s absence.
</p>
<p>
    Reactn supports strategies that are centred on brand power and customer loyalty. It also dovetails with the growing trend for high-tech and high-touch service solutions. While customers increasingly expect to self-serve, they also require a high quality service experience. Reactn helps you deliver both.
