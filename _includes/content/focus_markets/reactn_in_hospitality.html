    Hotels, bars, cafes and restaurants are under increased pressure to deliver a terrific customer experience, by offering innovation, quality and value for money.
</p>
<p>
    One way of achieving this is to find better ways of engaging with digitally active customers, especially those who expect personalised and multichannel communication.

    Knowing that the hospitality sector lives and dies on the quality of a customerâ€™s last visit, Reactn provides a simple and engaging channel for collecting customer feedback on site.
</p>
<p>
    At the same time our content management system is able to aggregate wider social media and review site content such as TripAdvisor alongside feedback generated through Reactn. This can then be directed to both management and front-line staff to address issues and respond to customers.
