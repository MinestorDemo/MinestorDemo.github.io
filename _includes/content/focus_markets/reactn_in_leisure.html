    Positive customer experience is the lifeblood of the leisure industry. As many more consumers see time and money as their two most precious resources, they are looking to the leisure industry to provide them with increased value for money and good use of down-time.

    By definition, what the leisure industry offers is a customer experience. Leisure’s success comes down to a simple measure of delight. And if customers are delighted, they are much more likely to come back for more. The metrics of satisfaction are not difficult to anticipate. Did customers find parking easily? Were the facilities clean? Simply – did people enjoy themselves?

    Despite this seeming simplicity, however, the UK’s leisure sector has seen customer satisfaction fall over the past couple of years, particularly among online and social media-savvy 25-34 year-olds. This places increased pressure on leisure companies to ensure that repeat customers are delivered both a consistent experience, but also one that evolves and stays competitive.
