<p>
    Positive customer experience is the lifeblood of the leisure industry. As many more consumers see time and money as their two most precious resources, they are looking to the leisure industry to provide them with increased value for money and good use of down-time.
</p>
<p>
    By definition, what the leisure industry offers is a customer experience. Leisure’s success comes down to a simple measure of delight. And if customers are delighted, they are much more likely to come back for more. The metrics of satisfaction are not difficult to anticipate. Did customers find parking easily? Were the facilities clean? Simply – did people enjoy themselves?
</p>
<p>
    Despite this seeming simplicity, however, the UK’s leisure sector has seen customer satisfaction fall over the past couple of years, particularly among online and social media-savvy 25-34 year-olds. This places increased pressure on leisure companies to ensure that repeat customers are delivered both a consistent experience, but also one that evolves and stays competitive.
</p>
<p>
    In response to this need, Reactn delivers a location- and time-relevant feedback mechanism that enables you to measure exact elements of your leisure offering, while at the same time collecting feedback on overall experiences and areas that can be improved. It draws customers further into the experience, asking them what they liked and didn’t like, what they would do differently, or even ideas they might have on making things better and more engaging.
</p>
<p>
    The sentiment data generated by Reactn can be used not only to profile time and location-specific performance, but also aid segmentation and customer profiling. By generating feedback, we can capture details such as location, gender and age, and then use this to segment your customers more precisely. Do retired customers in Newcastle care more about heating than cleanliness? Are 25-34 year olds in Bath more concerned with service friendliness than price? Reactn can be used to profile the customer journey and use this to predict behaviour.
</p>
<p>
    It also recognises the critical importance of staff performance in making or breaking the customer experience. This enables you to better utilise an often-overlooked asset, while ensuring development and training are targeted precisely for maximum return.
