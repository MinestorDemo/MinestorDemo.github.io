    By definition, what the leisure industry offers is a customer experience and its success comes down to a simple measure of delight. If customers are delighted, they are much more likely to come back for more, if they are not, you know the outcome. The metrics of satisfaction are not difficult to anticipate. Did customers find parking easily? Were the facilities clean? Simply â€“ did people enjoy themselves?

    Despite this seeming simplicity, the leisure sector has seen customer satisfaction fall over the past couple of years, particularly among online and social media-savvy 25-34 year-olds. This places increased pressure on leisure companies to ensure that repeat customers are delivered both a consistent experience, but also one that evolves and stays competitive.
