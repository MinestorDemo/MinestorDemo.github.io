        Reactn in Retail

    Retail growth and market share are strongly correlated to customer satisfaction. Apart from price and convenience, retail is a primarily service-driven sector. Retail organisations must swiftly adapt to changing customer requirements and deliver superior customer service in order to maximise sales and profits. A key driver of retail success is footfall. But once you have attracted shoppers into your stores you have to keep them there and keep them coming back. Reactn can help.

    Feedback is clearly vital to retail. In recent years, much of retail’s efforts at innovation have been focused on e-commerce. And online shopping has developed effective tools for review and recommendation. Consumers are highly likely to buy after seeing endorsements by other online shoppers, and they can easily create their own reviews if they wish to praise or damn the service they receive.

    But it is on the high street that real customer service is required – and is often lacking. Shops on the high street lag behind when it comes to understanding customer satisfaction.  Retail is highly varied in terms of product and experience – from buying a top-end luxury car to a basic loaf of bread in asupermarket. But there are obvious commonalities. Customers are clear about what they want. People don’t go into shops because they don’t like the environment or the service. Half of consumers won’t even enter a store if they see a queue inside, for example.

    Reactn can be a key weapon in the retail armoury. Despite the creation of sophisticated processes, websites and mobile applications, retailers are often let down by aging POS terminals,  hit-and-miss mystery shopper programmes or a reliance on staff memory to address customer feedback. They need a system that’s simple to use, always on and easily deployed.

    Reactn digitises customer feedback in-store, enabling retailers to improve the shopping experience and make it more relevant to the modern consumer. Our technology is ideally suited to the retail environment. Reactn’s geo-tagged database of retail locations helps customers easily select the right store for comment, for example. In-store technology such as Bluetooth beacons can alert customers via their phone to the retailer’s request for feedback, and point them to the appropriate questionnaire.

    At the same time, Reactn provides a dynamic bridge between online and offline environments, enabling multichannel strategies that benefit the customer and ultimately the business. And by integrating logistics and supply chain feedback into the same system,  Reactn can also trap insight across the entire customer journey, enabling retailers to deliver constant improvements to the wider experience, resulting in retained loyalty and greater share of wallet.
