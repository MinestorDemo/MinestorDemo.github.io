    Reactn can be a key weapon in the retail armoury. Despite the creation of sophisticated processes, websites and mobile applications, retailers are often let down by aging POS terminals,  hit-and-miss mystery shopper programmes or a reliance on staff memory to address customer feedback. They need a system that’s simple to use, always on and easily deployed.

    Reactn digitises customer feedback in-store, enabling retailers to improve the shopping experience and make it more relevant to the modern consumer. Our technology is ideally suited to the retail environment. Reactn’s geo-tagged database of retail locations helps customers easily select the right store for comment, for example. In-store technology such as Bluetooth beacons can alert customers via their phone to the retailer’s request for feedback, and point them to the appropriate questionnaire.

    At the same time, Reactn provides a dynamic bridge between online and offline environments, enabling multichannel strategies that benefit the customer and ultimately the business. And by integrating logistics and supply chain feedback into the same system,  Reactn can also trap insight across the entire customer journey, enabling retailers to deliver constant improvements to the wider experience, resulting in retained loyalty and greater share of wallet.
