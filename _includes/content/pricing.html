<p>
    Reactn is priced on a per-month and per-location basis. This encourages everyone to make as much use of the system as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Locations are not based on hard and fast rules, but on our understanding of your requirements and your customer’s needs. We’re not interested in stretching your budgets to breaking point, but we are interested in you taking the deployment of Reactn seriously and for the long-term. The only way to do this, is for both of us to make it work.
</p>
<p>
    Our pricing also takes into account the level of support, integration work, installation and technologies used. This ranges from employee training and change management workshops, to SDKs, Bluetooth beacons and kiosk solutions. These are essentially services that enable the system to work to its best abilities and make it as valuable as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Pricing will obviously depend on your requirements, but by its nature is a stepped process. As a result, the pricing structure is designed to support the testing of the process and further adoption of services and functions in phased increments.
